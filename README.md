# GYM_POSE_ESTIMATION

**GYM_POSE_ESTIMATION** is an AI-driven posture recognition system designed to assess injury risks during gym exercises. By leveraging computer vision and artificial intelligence, this project captures and analyzes user posture in real-time, providing immediate feedback to minimize injury risks and enhance workout effectiveness. 

Currently, the system is focused on analyzing posture for bicep curls. Future development will extend the system to evaluate a wider range of gym exercises.
